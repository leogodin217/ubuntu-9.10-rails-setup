This script will configure a new Ubuntu 9.10 system with enough software to develop rails applications.  It includes ruby, rails, rspec, git, vim and other packages.  

To use run edit the script to change leo to your username (%s/leo/<username>/g in vim).  Run sudo sh setup.sh".  In tests I found that the ruby download sometimes hangs.  If this happens delete the downloaded file and re-run the script.
